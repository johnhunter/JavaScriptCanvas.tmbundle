# Canvas.tmbundle #

A TextMate bundle for the HTML Canvas api.

[TextMate](http://macromates.com/) is a text editor / IDE for Mac OS X. This bundle adds functionality for developing with the HTML Canvas api.
For more information see:

*	[HTML Canvas specification](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html)
*	[MDN Canvas doc centre](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Canvas)


## Current status ##

The bundle currently only provides snippets for the Canvas api methods. This helps avoid looking up the documentation for method names and arguments. The completion also reduces typing effort.

**Note:** The bundle binds the alt-option-c key sequence while in the source.js context. That means alt-option-c will open a context menu listing all the api methods.

Contribution is very welcome. Fork and go for it!


## Installation ##

It should be possible to install this bundle using the excellent [GetBundles bundle](http://lists.macromates.com/textmate/2008-July/026119.html),
or the [TextMate Gem](http://yehudakatz.com/2008/05/19/textmate-gem/).

Otherwise you can:

*	`cd ~/Library/"Application Support"/TextMate/Bundles/`
*	if that directory wasn't found, you'll need to create it, then:
*	`git clone git@github.com:johnhunter/Canvas.tmbundle.git "Canvas.tmbundle"`
